                It appears that you are creating a TextView and a Button called "load button.
                " By setting an OnClickListener on the button, you can define the logic to fetch data
                from Firestore and display it in the TextView. This allows you to learn how to retrieve
                data from Firebase Firestore.

4th Lecture:
            The onStart() and onStop() methods are part of the Android Activity lifecycle.
            The onStart() method is called when the activity becomes visible to the user,
            and the onStop() method is called when the activity is no longer visible.
            You can override these methods to handle tasks such as loading or saving
            data when the app starts or stops.
